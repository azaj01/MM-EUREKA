## 🎯Overview

We present **MM-Eureka-Qwen-7B** and  **MM-Eureka-Qwen-32B**, both are powerful multimodal reasoning model that successfully extends large-scale rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal reasoning. Compared to the previous version of MM-EUREKA based on InternVL, we have made improvements in model architecture, algorithms, and data. For instance, MM-EUREKA-7B achieves **66.1** on MMK12 evaluation sets, only 0.2 points below Intern2.5-VL-78B. On MathVista, it reaches **73.0**, even surpassing InternVL2.5-VL-78B. MM-EUREKA-32B demonstrates stronger performance, scoring **72.3** on MMK12 evaluation sets, which exceeds both Qwen2.5-VL-72B's **70.3** and closed-source models like Gemini2-Flash, ranking second only to o1's **73.9**. On commonly used multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, MM-EUREKA-32B achieves **73.4** on WeMath, outperforming all open-source models and most closed-source models including Claude3.7 Sonnet. On MathVista, it reaches **74.8**, surpassing all open-source and closed-source models. Both variants demonstrate significant improvements in multidisciplinary K12 and mathematical reasoning performance, outperforming most open-source models of similar sizes.

**Core Improvements:**

1. We further iterate the codebase to support algorithms including Online Filter, [ADORA](https://github.com/ShadeCloak/ADORA?tab=readme-ov-file), and [DAPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476).
2. We open-source self-collected MMK12, which has 15k diverse and high-quality samples and 2k MCQs for Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology for evaluation.
3. We train the MM-Eureka-Qwen-7B and MM-Eureka-Qwen-32B, which are the almost top performancer in multimodal reasoning within similar size open-source models. Especially for Multidisciplinary K12 tasks.

🔥We open-source our complete pipeline to foster further research in this area. We release all our codes, models, data, etc. at [MM-EUREKA-Qwen](https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA/tree/qwen).

## 🚀 Features

This repository is built upon [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF), introducing several key enhancements:

- **Multimodal RFT Support**: Extends OpenRLHF to incorporate **vision-language models (VLMs)**, currently supporting **InternVL**, enabling multimodal reasoning capabilities.
  - Currently support **RLOO**, **REINFORCE++**, **GRPO** training using Ray.
  - vLLM integration and distributed training.
  - Support hybrid engine (`--colocate_all_models`, `--vllm_enable_sleep`).
- **Better Rule-based Reward support**: Better training visualization for Rule-based Rewards (i.g. Format Reward, Accuracy Reward, Repetition Penalty)
- **Enhanced Online Filtering**: Filtering out experiences based on Accuracy Reward during training as in [PRIME](https://github.com/PRIME-RL/PRIME)
  - Use `--enable_accuracy_filter`, `--freezing_filter_steps`, `--accuracy_lower_bound`, `--accuracy_upper_bound` to control the behavior of online accuracy filter.
- **ADORA**: Enable Adaptive Online Rollout Adjustment by using `--use_adora` and `--adora_lamda` as in [ADORA](https://five-stetson-b51.notion.site/Training-Reasoning-Model-with-Dynamic-Advantage-Estimation-on-Reinforcement-Learning-1a830cc0904681fa9df3e076b6557a3e).
- **DAPO**: You can use `--use_dapo` to enable DAPO loss during training as in [DAPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476).


## 🤖 Models

Based on the key factors identified by https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA for achieving stable training, we enhanced the model, dataset, and algorithmic modules. Specifically, we maintained the strategy of omitting the KL divergence term and applying data filtering, while implementing the following critical modifications:

- The base model was upgraded from InternVL2.5-8B-Instruct to the more powerful Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct.
- The Vision Transformer (ViT) module was frozen during training.
- The underlying RL algorithm was replaced with [GRPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300), instead of the previously used RLOO.
- The data filtering strategy was transitioned from an offline approach to an online approach.
- Additional data from the K12 dataset was collected, expanding the total dataset size to 15,000 samples.

Finally, MM-EUREKA-Qwen achieves 73.0 on MathVista, surpassing the original Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by 4.8%.
